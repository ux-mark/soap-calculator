# Ideal Soap Formulation Reference Table

## Liquid Soap Qualities

| Quality | Range (%) | Ideal (%) | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Hardness** | 5–15 | 8–12 | For liquid soap, low hardness is desirable as it promotes fluidity and pumpability. Coconut-derived saturated oils should be minimal to avoid solidification or viscosity problems. Too high causes the liquid soap to thicken excessively or crystallize. |
| **Cleansing** | 10–20 | 12–16 | Provides effective cleaning and lather in liquid form without stripping skin. Below 10% produces weak lather; above 20% can be too harsh and drying even in liquid formulation. |
| **Condition** | 65–80 | 72–77 | Ensures skin feel and barrier protection in liquid soap. Higher conditioning creates a gentler liquid product. Excessive conditioning (over 80%) can make the soap feel greasy or reduce effective cleaning power. |
| **Bubbly** | 5–12 | 7–10 | Creates lather in liquid soap form. Liquid soaps naturally produce less dramatic bubbles than bar soaps; moderate levels prevent over-foaming during pumping. Too high causes excessive foam overflow. |
| **Creamy** | 50–70 | 58–65 | Produces smooth, velvety lather texture in liquid form. Lower range than bar soap as unsaturated oils naturally soften liquid formulations. Below 50% produces thin, watery lather; above 70% creates overly viscous texture. |
| **Iodine** | 65–85 | 72–78 | Measures oil unsaturation level; higher values than bar soap are acceptable and desirable for liquid formulations. Low iodine can cause viscosity issues or separation. High iodine keeps oils in solution and maintains fluidity. |
| **INS (Iodine Number System)** | 70–90 | 78–85 | Balances fluidity with cleaning effectiveness. Below 70 produces overly thin, unstable liquid soap prone to separation. Above 90 can cause viscosity or solidification issues. Lower INS than bar soap is necessary for proper liquid consistency. |

## Individual Fatty Acids

| Fatty Acid | Type | Range (%) | Ideal (%) | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Lauric Acid** | Saturated | 5–10 | 7–8 | Creates cleansing power and abundant lather. Too low reduces lather; too high becomes harsh and drying. |
| **Myristic Acid** | Saturated | 5–10 | 7–8 | Works synergistically with lauric to create fluffy bubbles and cleansing. Similar concerns as lauric if excessive. |
| **Palmitic Acid** | Saturated | 7–12 | 9–10 | Major contributor to hardness and stability. Balances cleansing and conditioning. Below 7% weakens bar structure. |
| **Stearic Acid** | Saturated | 5–12 | 7–9 | Adds hardness and bar longevity without harshness. Higher levels create longer-lasting bars for stiffer formulas. |
| **Ricinoleic Acid** | Unsaturated (unique) | 0–5 | 2–3 | Adds creaminess and conditioning without softening bar too much. Comes from castor oil; rarely exceeds 5%. |
| **Oleic Acid** | Unsaturated (monounsaturated) | 15–25 | 18–20 | Primary conditioning fatty acid; skin-friendly and stable. Provides silky lather and moisturizing properties. |
| **Linoleic Acid** | Unsaturated (polyunsaturated) | 8–15 | 10–12 | Adds conditioning and skin benefits but softens bar if excessive. High levels slow cure time. |
| **Linolenic Acid** | Unsaturated (polyunsaturated) | 2–5 | 3–4 | Provides conditioning and skin nutrition. Very high levels (over 5%) can cause instability and rancidity. |

## Saturation Ratio

| Ratio | Range (%) | Ideal (%) | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Saturated Oils** | 40–50 | 44–48 | Creates hardness and bar stability. Below 40% produces soft, slow-curing soap; above 50% can be drying. |
| **Unsaturated Oils** | 50–60 | 52–56 | Provides conditioning and skin benefits. Balances hardness with gentleness. |

## Notes for Liquid Soap Formulation Success

- **For Sensitive Skin Liquid Soap:** Maximize Oleic Acid (18–22%), minimize Lauric + Myristic combined (below 12%), keep INS at 75–82 for gentle cleansing without harshness.
- **For Clear, Transparent Liquid Soap:** Use primarily unsaturated oils; keep Hardness below 10%, maintain Iodine above 75%, avoid coconut and palm oils.
- **For Thicker Liquid Soap Consistency:** Increase Creamy quality and Oleic Acid; add stearic acid sparingly (1–3%) to increase viscosity without causing separation.
- **For Foaming Liquid Soap:** Slightly increase Cleansing quality (14–18%) and Bubbly (8–12%), but balance with Condition to prevent skin irritation.
- **For Separation Prevention:** Maintain Iodine 70–85%, keep Hardness low (5–12%), ensure proper saponification ratio, and store at consistent temperatures.
- **For Fast-Processing:** Lower unsaturated oil content slightly; use faster-reacting oils like coconut. Increase temperature control to prevent over-thickening.
- **Starting Point Formula:** Build from 8% Hardness + 14% Cleansing + 72% Condition + 8% Bubbly + 60% Creamy as your baseline for balanced liquid soap, then adjust based on specific oil choices and desired properties.
