This guide will help you create your first soap recipe in minutes.

## Step 1: Set Your Recipe Parameters

In the **Recipe Inputs** section (top-left), configure:

1. **Total Oil Weight**: How much oil you want to use (e.g., 500g)
2. **Unit**: Choose grams (g), ounces (oz), or pounds (lb)
3. **Lye Type**: 
   - NaOH for bar soap
   - KOH for liquid soap
4. **Superfat**: Recommended 5-8% (default is 5%)
5. **Water Method**: Usually "Water as % of Oils" at 38% is fine
6. **Fragrance**: Optional - typically 3-6% of total oil weight
