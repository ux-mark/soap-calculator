# Understanding Oil Recommendations

The soap calculator provides intelligent oil recommendations with color-coded cards to help you create better recipes.

## Color Guide

### 🟢 Green - Highly Recommended (Score 70+)

**What it means:** This oil will significantly improve your recipe.

**What you'll see:**
- ✨ "Highly Recommended" badge
- Specific quality improvements with numbers
- Explanation of key fatty acids
- Practical benefits (like "bars unmold faster")
- Green "Add X%" button

**Example:**
```
Palm Oil - Highly Recommended

Brings hardness to 42 (ideal range) • 
49% palmitic + stearic • Saturated fats crystallize to form solid bar structure • 
Bars will unmold faster and last 3-4 weeks of daily use

Hardness: 18 → 42 ✓

Palmitic + Stearic: 49%

💡 Use as base oil at 25-40% for bar structure

[Add 25%]
```

### 🔵 Blue - Good Match (Score 50-69)

**What it means:** This oil is compatible and adds useful properties.

**What you'll see:**
- ℹ️ "Good Match" badge
- What the oil contributes
- Any caveats or considerations
- Suggested usage percentage
- Blue "Add X%" button

**Example:**
```
Sweet Almond Oil - Good Match

Adds 70% oleic for moisturizes skin without stripping natural oils • 
However, hardness moves to 35 • 
Best at 15% of recipe

Conditioning: 48 → 52 ✓
Hardness: 42 → 38

Oleic: 70%

💡 Excellent as main conditioning oil up to 50%

[Add 15%]
```

### 🟡 Yellow - Use With Caution (Score 30-49)

**What it means:** This oil can work but has trade-offs.

**What you'll see:**
- ℹ️ "Use With Caution" badge
- What it provides
- Warning about potential issues
- Low suggested percentage
- Yellow "Add X%" button

**Example:**
```
Grapeseed Oil - Use With Caution

Provides 70% linoleic • 
But hardness becomes 25 (want 29-54) • 
Use sparingly, max 10%

Conditioning: 52 → 58 ✓
Hardness: 42 → 25

Linoleic: 70%

[Add 10%]
```

### 🟠 Orange - Limited Compatibility (Score 25-29)

**What it means:** This oil barely works with your current selection.

**What you'll see:**
- ⚠️ "Limited Compatibility" badge
- Specific problems
- Strong warnings about issues
- Very low or no suggested percentage

**Example:**
```
Flaxseed Oil - Limited Compatibility

12% linolenic acid oxidizes rapidly • 
Orange spots appear within weeks to months • 
Keep under 5% of total oils

Iodine: 65 → 92 (max: 70)

Linolenic: 12%

⚠️ 12% linolenic acid oxidizes rapidly
Polyunsaturated fats develop rancidity (dreaded orange spots)

[Add 5%]
```

### 🔴 Red - Incompatible (Score <25)

**What it means:** This oil will cause problems in your recipe.

**What you'll see:**
- ⚠️ "Incompatible" badge
- Red warning about specific problem
- Visual result (what you'll actually see/feel)
- Suggested alternatives with reasons
- No "Add" button

**Example:**
```
Palm Oil - Incompatible (for Liquid Soap)

⚠️ 49% palmitic + stearic will solidify in KOH liquid soap • 
Creates waxy chunks or thick paste requiring heat to remain fluid • 
Try olive-oil instead: 69% oleic acid stays liquid in KOH soap

⚠️ Problems:
49% palmitic + stearic will solidify in KOH liquid soap
Saturated fats crystallize in potassium hydroxide solutions
Creates waxy chunks or thick paste requiring heat to remain fluid

💡 Try instead:
Olive Oil - 69% oleic acid stays liquid in KOH soap
No crystallization or thickening issues
```

## Understanding the Information

### Quality Projections

Shows how adding this oil will change your soap's properties:

```
Hardness: 18 → 42 ✓
```

- **18** = Current value
- **42** = Projected value after adding this oil
- **✓** = Moving toward ideal range (good!)
- *(no checkmark)* = Moving away from ideal (consider carefully)

### Fatty Acid Contributions

Highlights the key fatty acids in this oil:

```
Palmitic + Stearic: 49%
```

This tells you:
- Which acids are present
- Their percentage in the oil
- Why they're important (in the description)

### Usage Tips

Practical advice from soap making experience:

- 💡 "Keep under 10% - higher amounts make soap sticky" (Castor Oil)
- 💡 "15-25% range provides cleansing without being too drying" (Coconut Oil)
- 💡 "Use as base oil at 25-40% for bar structure" (Palm Oil)
- 💡 "Excellent as main conditioning oil up to 50%" (Olive Oil)

## When You're Just Starting

**Empty Recipe (0% selected):**

Recommendations focus on good base oils:
- Hard oils (palm, tallow) score higher for bar soap
- Soft oils (olive) score higher as starting points
- Specialty oils (castor) suggested at lower percentages

**Example recommendations:**
1. 🟢 Olive Oil - "Great starting oil for your recipe" (Score: 75)
2. 🟢 Coconut Oil 76° - "Great starting oil for your recipe" (Score: 75)
3. 🟢 Palm Oil - "Good starting oil for your recipe" (Score: 70)

## When Your Recipe Needs Work

**Low Hardness (< 29):**

Recommendations focus on hardening oils:
- 🟢 Palm Oil - "Brings hardness to 42 (ideal range)"
- 🟢 Cocoa Butter - "Brings hardness to 38 (ideal range)"
- 🔵 Shea Butter - "Increases hardness by 8 points"

**Low Conditioning (< 44):**

Recommendations focus on conditioning oils:
- 🟢 Olive Oil - "Brings conditioning to 55 (ideal range)"
- 🔵 Sweet Almond Oil - "Adds 70% oleic for conditioning"
- 🔵 Avocado Oil - "Increases conditioning by 12 points"

**Low Cleansing (< 12):**

Recommendations focus on cleansing oils:
- 🟢 Coconut Oil - "Brings cleansing to 18 (ideal range)"
- 🔵 Babassu Oil - "Adds 50% lauric for cleansing lather"

## Hard Soap vs. Liquid Soap

### Hard (Bar) Soap - NaOH

**Wants:**
- Hardness (29-54) for firm bars
- Balance of all qualities
- Variety of fatty acids

**Highly Recommended:**
- Palm oil (hardness)
- Olive oil (conditioning base)
- Coconut oil (cleansing & bubbles)
- Castor oil (creaminess)

**Incompatible:**
- Very soft oils at high %
- Oils that make bars too soft
- Too much of any one oil

### Liquid Soap - KOH

**Wants:**
- Low hardness (5-15) to stay liquid
- High oleic (>60%) for fluidity
- Low saturated fats (<20%)

**Highly Recommended:**
- Olive oil (high oleic)
- Sunflower oil (stays liquid)
- Safflower oil (low saturates)

**Incompatible:**
- Palm oil (too much palmitic/stearic)
- Cocoa butter (saturated fats)
- Tallow (will solidify)
- Most hard oils/butters

## Quick Tips

### ✅ Do:

- **Pay attention to colors** - Green is great, red is not
- **Read the quality projections** - See how your recipe will change
- **Use suggested percentages** - They're calculated for balance
- **Check usage tips** - Learn from experience
- **Try alternatives** - When oils are incompatible

### ❌ Don't:

- **Ignore red warnings** - They're based on chemistry
- **Use more than suggested** - Especially for specialty oils
- **Add all green oils** - You still need balance
- **Forget about total percentage** - Must equal 100%
- **Skip reading explanations** - Understand WHY

## Common Scenarios

### "I want a simple recipe"

Start with the classics:
1. 🟢 Add Olive Oil at 50%
2. 🟢 Add Coconut Oil at 25%
3. 🟢 Add Palm Oil at 20%
4. 🔵 Add Castor Oil at 5%

### "My bars are too soft"

Look for green cards that say:
- "Brings hardness to [higher number]"
- "Saturated fats crystallize to form solid structure"
- "Creates firm bars"

Common solutions: Palm oil, Cocoa butter, Tallow

### "My soap is drying"

Look for:
- High cleansing value going down
- Conditioning value going up
- Oils with high oleic acid

Common solutions: Reduce coconut, add olive/almond/avocado

### "I want big fluffy bubbles"

Look for:
- "Bubbly" quality increasing
- Lauric or ricinoleic acid
- Mentions of "lather" or "bubbles"

Common solutions: Coconut oil, Castor oil

### "I'm making liquid soap"

**Only use oils with:**
- 🟢 Green or blue colors
- High oleic acid (>60%)
- Low saturated fats

**Avoid all:**
- 🔴 Red cards
- "Will solidify" warnings
- Hard oils and butters

## Understanding Chemistry Terms

**Palmitic/Stearic Acids:**
- Saturated fats
- Make bars hard
- Slow to dissolve
- Not good for liquid soap

**Oleic Acid:**
- Monounsaturated fat
- Conditioning
- Stays liquid
- Perfect for liquid soap

**Lauric/Myristic Acids:**
- Short-chain fats
- Cleansing power
- Creates big bubbles
- Can be drying if too much

**Linoleic/Linolenic Acids:**
- Polyunsaturated fats
- Conditioning
- Can go rancid (DOS)
- Makes bars soft

**Ricinoleic Acid:**
- Unique to castor oil
- Boosts lather
- Creates creaminess
- Use 5-10% only

## Getting Help

If recommendations seem wrong:
1. Check your soap type (hard vs. liquid)
2. Verify your current oils are correct
3. Make sure percentages add up correctly
4. Read the full explanation, not just the score
5. Consider the specific warnings

The recommendation system is based on:
- Decades of soap making wisdom
- Chemical properties of oils
- Ideal quality ranges from SoapCalc
- Real-world formulation experience

Trust the chemistry, but learn as you go!
