# Liquid Soap Formulation Guide

@copilot please remind me thie needs to be added into the interface. I want to be able to show these recommendation numbers in the soap qualities and fatty acids section for liquid soap formulations.
I need to consider how to oeverlay this with the values of the selected oils. I want to have a better way to help the user configure the fatty acids that are needed. I am thinking maybe some sort of colapsable panel for each quality that includes the fatty acids for the selected oils and the way the fats total to that the total value for the quality.

## Superfat: 0-3%

**Bar soap typically uses 5-8% superfat. Liquid soap requires 0-3%.**

**Why Lower Superfat?**
- Excess oils don't stay emulsified in diluted soap
- Causes cloudiness and separation
- Shortens shelf life (oils go rancid)
- Creates film on skin and in bottles

**Best Practice:**
- Use 0% superfat for commercial/clear soap
- Use 1-3% for personal use if you want extra conditioning
- If using 3%+ superfat, add polysorbate 80 or other emulsifiers

## Fatty Acid Requirements

### Overview: The Critical Balance
**Liquid Soap Balance:** ~20-30% saturated : ~70-80% unsaturated

### Saturated Fatty Acids (The "Hard" Fats)

#### **Lauric Acid (C12) - Target: 0-15%**

**Sources:** Coconut oil (48%), Palm Kernel oil (48%), Babassu oil (50%)

**Properties:**
- High cleansing power
- Creates fluffy, quick lather
- Can be harsh/drying
- Very soluble in water

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 5-10%**
- **Maximum: 15%**
- **Why lower than bar soap:** Diluted soap amplifies cleansing effect; high lauric becomes stripping
- **Effect on product:** Too high causes harsh, drying soap that strips skin oils

**When to use more (10-15%):**
- Dish soap or cleaning products
- Industrial/hand cleaner applications
- When maximum cleansing is priority

**When to use less (0-5%):**
- Facial cleansers
- Baby soap
- Sensitive skin formulations

---

#### **Myristic Acid (C14) - Target: 0-10%**

**Sources:** Coconut oil (19%), Palm Kernel oil (16%), Babassu oil (20%)

**Properties:**
- Contributes to hardness (paste firmness)
- Adds cleansing power
- Creates fluffy lather
- Medium solubility

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 3-7%**
- **Maximum: 10%**
- **Combined with Lauric:** Keep total under 15% for gentle soap

**Behavior:** Works synergistically with lauric acid for cleansing and bubble formation.

---

#### **Palmitic Acid (C16) - Target: 2-10%**

**Sources:** Palm oil (44%), Lard (25%), Tallow (26%), Cocoa butter (25%)

**Properties:**
- Creates paste firmness
- Contributes to creamy, stable lather
- Lower solubility than lauric/myristic
- Forms crystalline structures

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 4-8%**
- **Maximum: 10% (15% if cloudiness acceptable)**

**CRITICAL CONSIDERATION:**
- Palmitic acid causes cloudiness/opacity in liquid soap
- Can lead to separation issues
- Makes paste harder to dilute
- For crystal-clear soap, keep palmitic under 6%

**Trade-off:**
- Higher palmitic = cloudier but creamier lather
- Lower palmitic = clearer but potentially less creamy

---

#### **Stearic Acid (C18) - Target: 2-10%**

**Sources:** Shea butter (40%), Cocoa butter (35%), Mango butter (45%), Hydrogenated soy (85%)

**Properties:**
- Longest saturated chain commonly used
- Creates very stable lather
- Contributes to paste firmness
- Least soluble of the common saturated FAs

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 3-7%**
- **Maximum: 10% (15% if cloudiness acceptable)**

**CRITICAL CONSIDERATION:**
- Stearic acid is the PRIMARY cause of cloudiness
- Even more problematic than palmitic for clarity
- Can cause soap to "seize" during paste making if too high
- Requires more dilution water

**Combined Palmitic + Stearic:**
- **For clear soap: 5-12% total**
- **For cloudy soap: up to 20% total**

**Why these matter together:** Both have similar behavior - they want to crystallize and form structured soaps. In liquid soap, this fights against the goal of staying fluid and clear.

### Unsaturated Fatty Acids (The "Soft" Fats)

#### **Oleic Acid (C18:1) - Target: 50-70%**

**Sources:** High-oleic sunflower (82%), Olive oil (72%), Canola oil (64%), Sweet almond oil (70%), Avocado oil (70%)

**Properties:**
- Monounsaturated (one double bond)
- Creates conditioning soap
- Contributes to viscosity/thickness
- Very stable (doesn't go rancid quickly)

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 50-60%**
- **Minimum: 45%**
- **Maximum: 70%**

**WHY OLEIC ACID IS THE STAR OF LIQUID SOAP:**

This is THE most important fatty acid for liquid soap formulation. Here's why:

**Viscosity Control:**
- 50-60% oleic creates thick, syrupy soap with reasonable dilution
- Below 45% = cannot achieve thick texture without additives
- Above 70% = requires excessive dilution, resulting in weak/watery soap

**The Science:**
- Oleic acid creates a specific molecular arrangement in potassium soap
- Forms "entangled" soap micelles that trap water
- Creates natural viscosity without needing thickeners

**Practical Examples:**
- Recipe with 40% oleic: Needs 1:1 dilution, stays thin like water
- Recipe with 55% oleic: Needs 1:2.5 dilution, achieves thick honey-like texture
- Recipe with 75% oleic: Needs 1:5 dilution, becomes very dilute/weak

**Formulation Strategy:**
Use high-oleic oils as your BASE:
- Olive oil (72% oleic) - traditional base
- High-oleic sunflower (80%+ oleic) - economical alternative
- High-oleic safflower (78% oleic)
- Avocado oil (70% oleic) - luxury option

---

#### **Ricinoleic Acid (C18:1-OH) - Target: 5-15%**

**Source:** Castor oil (90% ricinoleic)

**Properties:**
- Unique hydroxyl group (-OH) on the fatty acid chain
- Highly polar (water-loving)
- Creates "solvating" effect
- Very thick, viscous oil

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 10-15%**
- **Minimum: 5%**
- **Maximum: 20%**

**SPECIAL ROLE IN LIQUID SOAP:**

Ricinoleic acid is functionally unique among all fatty acids:

1. **Clarity Enhancement:**
   - The hydroxyl group helps keep other fatty acids in solution
   - Prevents cloudiness from palmitic/stearic acids
   - Acts as a built-in solubilizer

2. **Lather Boost:**
   - Dramatically increases bubble formation
   - Creates stable, long-lasting foam
   - Works synergistically with lauric/myristic

3. **Viscosity Contribution:**
   - Adds body and thickness
   - Helps achieve syrupy texture
   - Prevents over-thinning

4. **Humectant Properties:**
   - Attracts moisture to skin
   - Leaves skin feeling conditioned
   - Reduces drying effect of cleansing

**Practical Use:**
- 10% castor oil = 9% ricinoleic acid
- 15% castor oil = 13.5% ricinoleic acid
- Almost ALWAYS included in liquid soap recipes

**Caution:**
- Above 20% can make soap too thick/sticky
- Can slow trace during paste making
- Very expensive in large quantities

---

#### **Linoleic Acid (C18:2) - Target: 5-15%**

**Sources:** Sunflower oil (60%), Safflower oil (70%), Soybean oil (54%), Hemp oil (55%)

**Properties:**
- Polyunsaturated (two double bonds)
- Highly conditioning
- Creates "silky" feel
- Prone to oxidation/rancidity

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 8-12%**
- **Maximum: 15%**

**THE RANCIDITY PROBLEM:**

Linoleic acid is a double-edged sword:

**Benefits:**
- Excellent skin conditioning
- Light, silky feel
- Easily absorbed by skin
- Good for acne-prone skin

**Drawbacks:**
- Oxidizes quickly (goes rancid)
- Creates "Dreaded Orange Spots" (DOS)
- Shortens shelf life dramatically
- Especially problematic in diluted soap (more water = faster degradation)

**The 15% Rule:**
Most experienced soap makers keep **combined linoleic + linolenic under 15%** to prevent:
- Orange spots developing in soap
- Rancid smell
- Loss of lather over time
- Shortened shelf life

**Formulation Strategy:**
- Use oils with moderate linoleic content
- Avoid high-linoleic sunflower/safflower (70%+)
- Add antioxidants (ROE, Vitamin E) if using higher amounts
- Consider high-oleic variants of oils instead

---

#### **Linolenic Acid (C18:3) - Target: 0-5%**

**Sources:** Flaxseed oil (55%), Hemp oil (20%), Walnut oil (13%)

**Properties:**
- Polyunsaturated (THREE double bonds)
- Extremely conditioning
- VERY prone to oxidation
- Shortest shelf life of all FAs

**For Liquid Soap:**
- **Ideal: 1-3%**
- **Maximum: 5%**
- **Combined with Linoleic: Maximum 15% total**

**MOST PROBLEMATIC FATTY ACID:**

Linolenic acid oxidizes faster than any other common fatty acid:

- Three double bonds = three oxidation sites
- Goes rancid within months
- Creates fishy/paint-like smell
- Causes DOS very quickly

**Best Practice:**
- Avoid oils high in linolenic acid for liquid soap
- If present, keep below 3%
- ALWAYS add antioxidants
- Use product within 6-12 months

**Oils to Avoid or Minimize:**
- Flaxseed oil (55% linolenic) - DO NOT USE
- Hemp oil (20% linolenic) - use sparingly
- Walnut oil (13% linolenic) - use sparingly

## Soap Quality Metrics for Liquid Soap

### **1. Hardness (Saturated Fatty Acid Total)**

```
Hardness = Lauric + Myristic + Palmitic + Stearic
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 10-25 (LOWER is better)

**What it means in liquid soap:**
- Firmness of paste before dilution
- Difficulty of dilution (higher = harder to dilute)
- Tendency toward cloudiness
- Crystallization potential

**Target: 15-20** for most liquid soaps

**Interpretation:**
- 10-15: Very soft paste, dilutes easily, crystal clear potential
- 15-20: Moderate paste, dilutes well, some cloudiness possible
- 20-25: Firm paste, requires more water, likely cloudy
- 25+: Very firm paste, difficult to dilute, opaque

---

### **2. Cleansing (Lauric + Myristic)**

```
Cleansing = Lauric + Myristic
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 5-15 (gentler)

**What it means:**
- Harshness/stripping potential
- Grease-cutting ability
- Skin feel after washing

**Target: 8-12** for most purposes

**Interpretation:**
- 0-5: Very gentle, minimal cleansing (face wash, baby soap)
- 5-10: Gentle everyday cleansing
- 10-15: Moderate cleansing power
- 15-20: Strong cleansing (dish soap, industrial)
- 20+: Very harsh, drying

---

### **3. Conditioning (Unsaturated FA Total)**

```
Conditioning = Oleic + Ricinoleic + Linoleic + Linolenic
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 60-80+ (HIGHER is better)

**What it means:**
- Moisturizing ability
- Mildness to skin
- Fluidity of final product

**Target: 65-75** for most liquid soaps

**Interpretation:**
- 50-60: Lower conditioning, may feel drying
- 60-70: Good conditioning, balanced
- 70-80: High conditioning, very mild
- 80+: Maximum conditioning, may be too mild

---

### **4. Bubbly Lather**

```
Bubbly = Lauric + Myristic + Ricinoleic
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 15-30

**What it means:**
- Quick, fluffy bubble formation
- Initial lather when first applied
- Light, airy foam

**Target: 18-25** for good bubbles

**Includes ricinoleic:** Castor oil significantly boosts this number

---

### **5. Creamy Lather**

```
Creamy = Palmitic + Stearic + Ricinoleic
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 20-40

**What it means:**
- Stable, long-lasting lather
- Dense, yogurt-like foam
- Lather longevity

**Target: 25-35** for stable foam

---

### **6. Iodine Value**

```
Iodine = Sum of (each oil's iodine value × percentage)
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 50-80 (higher acceptable)

**What it means:**
- Degree of unsaturation
- Softness of soap
- Oxidation potential

**Target: 55-70** for liquid soap

**Interpretation:**
- Below 50: Very saturated, paste will be very firm
- 50-60: Moderate unsaturation, good balance
- 60-70: High unsaturation, fluid paste
- 70-80: Very high unsaturation, may be too soft
- Above 80: Extremely high, rancidity risk

---

### **7. INS Value (Combined Quality Metric)**

```
INS = Sum of (each oil's INS × percentage)
```
**For Liquid Soap:** 100-150 (LOWER is better)

**What it means:**
- Overall physical properties
- Combined measure of saturation, solubility, iodine
- General quality indicator

**Target: 120-140** for liquid soap

**Why lower than bar soap:**
- Lower INS = softer, more fluid soap
- Bar soap needs higher INS for firmness
- Liquid soap needs lower INS for fluidity
